## Summary
----
Hello! 大家好! I am Reinald Adrian Pugoy, a PhD candidate at the [Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ncku.edu.tw/), National Cheng Kung University in Tainan City, Taiwan. I am a member of the [Intelligent Knowledge Management Lab](https://ikmlab.csie.ncku.edu.tw) under the supervision of [Prof. Hung-Yu Kao](http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~hykao/). My current research deals with the intersection of Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning.

I am also an Assistant Professor (on study leave) at the [University of the Philippines - Open University](https://fics.upou.edu.ph), which pioneered Open and Distance e-Learning in the Philippines. Courses I taught include Programming Languages, and I handled mostly graduate students. I also designed and shepherded the first AI course in the university. 

I received both my MS and BS degrees from the [University of the Philippines - Los Baños](https://uplb.edu.ph/main/) where I used to do research on Digital Image Processing and VoIP, respectively.

Nice to meet you!
